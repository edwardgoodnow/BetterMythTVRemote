MythTV Web Remote ISSUES
------------------------

Limited IE Support
------------------
At present the roll overs don't work very well in IE. Also the way the icons
are mapped as submit buttons needs modification as in IE it submits the image
co-ordinates rather than the value

Rapid Clicking can cause mythfrontend to freeze
-----------------------------------------------
Possible an issue with the telnet control interface. If a user clicks too
rapidly it can cause the front end to lock up, requiring a restart of the GUI.

Roll Over images required for remaining buttons
-----------------------------------------------
At present only the number and text buttons have rollover and click alternate
images
